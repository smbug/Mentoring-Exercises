Notes

1. I considered creating a more customisable 'FizzBuzzGenerator' class, where:
   * The 'fizzFactor' and 'buzzFactor' were private fields and had default values of 3 and 5, respectively.
   * There was a second constructor, which enabled the caller to specify the 'fizzFactor'and 'buzzFactor' fields.
Ultimately, I decided that this approach was a bit too over engineered.

2. The README.md file said to "open nunit.exe (tools\nunit-2.6.3\bin\nunit.exe)". This folder wasn't 
a part of the solution, so I downloaded it from the NUnit site.
